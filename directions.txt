Instructions:

As a best practice, sketch the architecture of your application before you start writing code.

For this exercise, start by describing what your application does. Do this in a bullet list.

Next, decide how you might divvy up these responsibilities. Would you write a single module that handles all of them? Would you write one module for each bullet list? Something else? Be sure to justify your decision.

Finally, draw a diagram describing the relationships between your modules. Each arrow should describe a dependencyâ€”that is, an arrow from module A to module B indicates that module A uses module B.
